# Identifiability-of-Directed-Cycle-and-Catenary-Linear-Compartmental-Models
This repository contains TXT and PDF files with the data used in the paper of the same name.

The PDF files list the specific type of identifiability of each parameter of a three-compartment catenary model with one input, one output, and up to one leak. The Model Database TXT files list the specific type of identifiability of each parameter of a three, four, and five-compartment model with one input, one output, and the specified number of leaks. Note that files labeled as CYC refer to directed-cycle models and CAT refers to catenary models. The CAT Iterative Tree file contains an example of input-output equations for a three-compartment catenary model with one input, one output, and up to one leak.
